# Docker Tutorial/Sample Application

Source: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

## Tutorial Step-by-step
### Initial application setup
1. Copied `/app` directory from https://github.com/docker/getting-started/tree/master/app into personal repo.
1. Created `Dockerfile` into the `/app` directory. Added docker commands to `Dockerfile`.
1. cd into the `/app` directory and run the following command: `docker build -t getting-started-docker . `. This builds the docker container image using a tag name of `getting-started-docker` in the current directory (which is `/app`).
1. Start the app container! Use the following command: `docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started-docker`. The whole command says run the docker container `getting-started-docker` (tag name stated in the build command) using the flag designations. The `-dp` flags designate running the container in "detached" mode and create a "port" mapping from the host's port 3000 to the container's port 3000. The output after running this command is a sha (Secure Hash Algorithm) value.

### Update the application
1. After making changes, run the same build command. If you try to run/start the container immediately, you'll hit an error regarding a port already in use/allocated. This indicates that the old container is still running, and the error stems from the new container trying to use the host's port 3000 when only one process on the machine can listen to a specific port at one time. So how do we fix this?
1. Stop the old container and then remove it. Don't need to remove container after stopping it, but it's good practice.
1. Identify the running container you want to stop: `docker ps`
1. Once you have the Container ID, stop the container: `docker stop <container id>`
1. After the container stops (you can verify using `docker ps -a`), remove the container: `docker rm <container id>`
1. Bonus: You can stop and remove container at one time using the force flag `docker rm -f <container id>`

### Share the application
#### Create a repo
1. Create a repository on [Docker Hub](hub.docker.com).
1. Name the repo (nameed this one `getting-started-docker`) and make sure visibility is `Public`.
1. Click the `Create` button.
#### Push the image
1. Notice the Docker command that hints at how to push a new tag to the repo: `docker push <dockerNamespace>/getting-started-docker:tagname`
1. If you try running that push command now, you'll get an error: 
```
Using default tag: latest
The push refers to repository [docker.io/<dockerNamespace>/getting-started-docker]
An image does not exist locally with the tag: <dockerNamespace>/getting-started-docker
```
3. Why did this happen? Well, the push command was looking for an image name `<dockerNamespace>/getting-started-docker` and didn't find one. If you list images `docker images`, you won't find it there either. To fix this, we need to "tag" our existing image to give it a different name. Let's do that.
1. Login to Docker Hub from the command line `docker login -u YOUR-USER-NAME`. Enter password when prompted.
1. Use the `docker tag` command to give the `getting-started-docker` image a new name: `docker tag getting-started-docker YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started-docker`
1. Now try the push command again: `docker push YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started`. It works! ðŸŽ‰
#### Run the image on a new instance
1. Now that the image has been built and pushed into a registry, now it's time to try running the app on a brand new instance that has never seen this container image. Use Play with Docker to do this.
1. Open [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) in a new browser window.
1. Login using your Docker Hub account credentials. Select `Start`.
1. Click on the `ADD NEW INSTANCE` on the left side bar.
1. In the terminal, start the app! `docker run -dp 3000:3000 YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started-docker`
1. Click on the 3000 badge when it comes up and this will open a new tab with your app running! If the 3000 badge doesn't show up, you can click on the "Open Port" button and type in 3000 manually.

### Persist the DB



## Helpful commands
* List docker images on machine: `docker images` or `docker image ls`
* List docker containers/processes: `docker ps` and `docker ps -a`
* Start image/container: `docker start <image name>` or `docker start <container id>`
* Stop image/container: `docker stop <image name>` or `docker stop <container id>`
* Delete container: `docker rm <container id>`
* Stop and remove container in one command: `docker rm -f <container id>`
